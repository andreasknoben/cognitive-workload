VB_P2    The number of buses in use at the time of the trip were lower than the number of buses in use when the trip was scheduled 4 months in advance, the bus that was supposed to be used for the trip is now in maintenance, the bus meant for this trip is now being used for a trip comprising of different route segments.

VB_P3                                                 There was a large number of passengers with reservations, so not all those without a reservation who were hoping to board the bus managed to grab a seat after arriving to the station, as the capicity of the bus was full / in other words, more people without reservation showed up than the seats without reservation available

Multiple mechanics needed to work on the machine. Maybe one of them needed to be repaired more urgent so they charged more for that. 
FE_P4                                             You do not know beforehand if you might find other things that need to be repaired. Manufacturers can change their prices for parts as well. It is hard to estimate the time of the repair. Mechanics with more skills might be faster than mechanics without the same skills and/or years of experience. 
FE_P5       The new machine will replace some of the mechanics and their skills. Different parts are needed to be stored in the warehouse. The machine itself also needs maintainance, and you need parts for that as well. You might need different manufacturers for it. The total cost of repairs might change. Also the time of the repair will change.
