The objectives of Voyager are to provide high quality and safe traveling experiences for tourists. 
There are two ways for people to travel with Voyager. Passengers can either make a reservation on a trip, or passengers can show up at the boarding gate without a reservation and purchase a ticket for an unreserved seat. Passengers with a reservation are assigned a reservation date, whereas, passengers without reservations are assigned a boarding date. The name and addresses of all passengers are collected. Telephone numbers are collected where possible. 
All bus trips are organized into daily route segments. All daily route segments have both a start time and an end time. Each daily route segment Voyager organizes is classified as a route segment with a segment number, start town, and finish town. Voyager offers a range of trips, and each trip is made up of one or more route segments. For every trip there is a trip number, start town, and finish town. If the trip is organized around a special event, the event name is also associated with the trip. 
Each daily route segment that Voyager offers is part of a daily trip. A daily trip is undertaken by one or more bus drivers. The name, address, and employee number of all drivers are collected. Voyager also records information about absent drivers. When a driver is absent, Voyager records the absence start date and the details about the absence. The absent driver provides one or more reasons for being absent and each reason is assigned a detail number and a short description.
Voyager also collects information about the buses used for daily drips. Buses have a make, model, and registration number. For buses in use, the average daily kilometers is collected. If a bus requires maintenance, Voyager notes the date on which the bus entered maintenance and records the one or more problems with the bus. Voyager assigns a problem number and a short description for every maintenance problem. Finally, the average cost to repair all problems with a bus in maintenance is also recorded.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,Can a trip be made up of more than one route segment?,Does a person have to make a reservation to go on a trip?,Can a daily trip be assigned to more than one bus?,Does Voyager Bus Inc. collect the same set of information for all of the passengers?,Can the same daily route segment be associated with two different trip numbers?,Can Voyager Bus Inc. record a maintenance problem that has not yet been experienced by any of their buses?,Is the daily route segment modeled as an entity?,Can a bus driver be assigned to more than one daily trip?,Are all buses that are available for use assigned to a daily route segment?,Is model an attribute of bus?,Is the average cost of repair recorded for all buses in maintenance?,Can the end town assigned to a route segment be different from the end town associated with a trip that uses the route segment?,Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"An employee at Voyager Bus Inc. has come up with an idea for a new trip, and has assigned the trip with a trip number, start town, and end town.
